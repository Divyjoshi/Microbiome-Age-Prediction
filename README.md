## Microbiome-Age-Prediction

### Research Problem

Research Gap (Ground-Truth Identification):
No precise definition has been given for eubiosis beyond a ‘balanced’ microbiota or a microbiota found in healthy subjects. The clear definition of the eubiotic microbiota is particularly important for case–control studies. If the healthy eubiotic micro-biota is well defined, both semantically and by its microbiota composition, only microbiota data from a small numbers of control subjects would be needed. In this research, we aim to develop a tool that characterizes/distinguishes healthy gut microbiota.

Research Gap (Microbial Age):
The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that both affects and is affected by its host status. High-throughput methods allow to observe changes in microflora composition between host cohorts, but it is not always evident which of them are pathological and which represent transition between alternative healthy states. In this research, we aim to develop a model that accounts for normal changes associated with healthy aging via predicting the microbial age of an individual.
